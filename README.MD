## This Project

This website was made for my CS108 Web Design class. It is made in pure vanilla HTML and CSS, with no Javascript, templates, or LLM generated code.

I planned to add way more videos and concepts, but I ran out of time. I may return to this project in the future. Will more likely than not be only a video series.

I'm sorry if there is artifacting/visual glitches in the gifs. I don't have the time to scale them properly.
