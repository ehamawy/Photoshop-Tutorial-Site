            <h1>Photoshop vs Illustrator (Rasters vs Vectors)</h1>
            <h2>When should I use Photoshop vs Illustrator?</h2>
            <p>This is a great question, but first we must understand the difference between two kinds of images: rasters and vectors.</p>
            <p>I made a video that explains this on the right.</p>
            <h2>Rasters</h2>
            <p>Raster images are the typical pictures we interact with every day. When we take a picture and save it on the computer, they are broken down into a grid of tiny squares called Pixels. They are suited best for portraying real life photographs, however, there's a catch. They are bad at displaying sharp text, and become blocky or blurry when zoomed in. This is the kind of image Adobe Photoshop is made to create.</p>
            <h2>Vectors</h2>
            <p>Vector images are just as common. They are collections of geometric shapes, lines, and points. They are most suitable for creating logos, abstract designs, and stylized text. Almost all logos are made as vector images! Their strongsuit is their ability to losslessly scale, or, no matter how far you zoom in, they never loose any quality like rasters do! This is great for printing on things like shirts and billboards. However, there are downsides to vectors too. They are unable to depict fine textures, so a real photograph could never be saved as a vector. If you want vectors, you'll want to use Illustrator.</p>
